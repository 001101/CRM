# Contributing to ChurchCRM

An introduction to contributing to the ChurchCRM project.

The project welcomes, and depends, on contributions from developers and users in the open source community. Contributions can be made in a number of ways, a few examples are:

- Code patches via pull requests
- Documentation improvements
- Bug reports and patch reviews

## Reporting an issue?

Please include as much detail as you can. Let us know your platform and ChurchCRM version. If the problem is visual (for example a theme or design issue) please add a screenshot and if
you get an error please include the the full error and traceback.

## Submitting Pull Requests

Once you are happy with your changes or you are ready for some
feedback, push it to your fork and send a pull request. For a
change to be accepted it will most likely need to have tests and
documentation if it is a new feature. (once we have tests that is )
