**ChurchCRM is currently still in development.**

We're progressing quickly, but the documentation still needs filling in, and there are a few rough edges.  The 1.0 release is planned to arrive in the next few months.

## Installation

ChurchCRM is a PHP/MySQL application which runs on a web server, providing web pages so users can update and access the data in the database. You can run both the server and the browser on a single computer, but the real power of a web database application is visible when you have multiple users accessing the database from their own computers.

## Getting started

## Deploying

The documentation site that we've just built only uses static files so you'll be able to host it from pretty much anywhere. [GitHub project pages] and [Amazon S3] are good hosting options. Upload the contents of the entire `site` directory to wherever you're hosting your website from and you're done.
